steps to make:-



1) Choose ripe, red and less sour tomatoes.Wash them well and cube them along with 1 medium onion.Onion adds a sweet flavor to the tomato soup.

2) Heat 1 tablespoon of oil or butter in a pan.Then add 1 small bay leaf, 2 garlic cloves and chopped onions.

3) Fry them on a high flame for 3-4 minutes until they are slightly roasted.This brings out the sweet flavor from onions.

4) Add tomatoes and sprinkle 1/3 teaspoon salt.You can also add a small carrot(if needed).

5) Cook them until slightly soft.Add 2 to 3 stalks of basil and cook until  tomatoes and onions turn completely mushy.If you don't have basil, you may skip them.

6) Cool the mixture.Discard basil and bay leaf.

7) Transfer to a blender jar and pour 1 cup of water.Blend to a smooth puree.Blend very well until smooth.



STRAINING:-



8) Firstly place a sieve over the pan or pot.Pour the blended mixture abd filter.Discard the coarse particles.Bring the soup to a boil on a medium heat.

9) Meanwhile add three-fourth tablespoon contash(corn flour) or arrowroot powder to half cup water and mix well to make a slurry.Ensure there are no lumps of flour.

10) Once the tomato soup comes to boil, simmer for 2 to 3 minutes.Then gradually stir the corn flour mixture.

11) Next stir in sugar.Boil this well until the tomato soup thickens and raw the flavor of the flour has gone.Taste this and add more salt if needed.

12) When it reaches your desired consistancy then add herbs and black pepper.Turn off the stove.

13) Set the pot aside and stir in 2 to 4 tablespoon cream if using.You can also make cashew cream if you don't prefer daily.Saok the cashew nuts in one-fourth cup of hot water for 30 minutes.Add them to a small chutney grinder along with the soak water in puree until you get a thick and smooth cream.If needed add a few tablespoon more water for consistency.Use this to top your tomato while serving.



MAKING CROUTANS:-



14) Croutons loose the crispness if left for too long so toast the bread just before you serve the soup.Butter the bread on both the sides.

15) Heat a pan and toast themon a medium heat until crisp.You can also add some grated garlic and red chilli flakes to the breatd and toast.You can also toast them in a oven.

16) Cool them and cut with a knife.

17) Lastly transfer tomato soup to serving bowls.Garnish with herbs and cream.
